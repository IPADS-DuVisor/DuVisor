DuVisor is a user-level hypervisor with high performance based on delegated virtualization. It deprivileges all the vulnerable subsystems of traditional hypervisors into user space, reducing the host kernelâ€™s attack surface and preventing any of hypervisor's vulnerabilities from jeopardizing it. The Rust language and one-to-one model further ensures the isolation and reliability.

## Why DuVisor

Compared with traditional virtualization, DuVisor offers several advantages:

1. **High Security:** By using a deprivileged hypervisor, DuVisor eliminates the kernel's attack surface introduced by virtualization. Moreover, the one-to-one service model improves the isolation between virtual machines (VMs) and the fault tolerance of the system.

2. **Near-native Performance:** DuVisor eliminates redundant mode switching, thereby fully unleashing the potential performance of virtualization. The integrated design also improves cooperation between modules, making the code more efficient.

3. **Agile Development:** Because of the thriving software environment in user space, DuVisor is no longer constrained by kernel development environments and can freely choose programming languages and existing libraries. Currently, the project uses Rust to ensure security and takes advantage of its powerful testing framework to improve project quality.

4. **Flexible Operations and Maintenance:** DuVisor can be upgraded without rebooting the host system. New features and functionalities can be deployed more quickly. Cloud services will have better fault tolerance, benefiting from DuVisor's strong isolation.

## Duvisor's Architecture

DuVisor adopts a one-to-one model to serve virtual machines (VMs) directly in user space, providing greater isolation to the entire system.

<picture>
    <source media="(prefers-color-scheme: dark)" srcset="./figures/arch-dark.png 3x">
    <source media="(prefers-color-scheme: light)" srcset="./figures/arch-light.png 3x">
    <img alt="Architecture of DuVisor." src="./figures/arch-light.png 3x">
</picture>

With a separate hypervisor process that only serves itself, each VM gains stronger isolation from other VMs and DuVisor processes. Additionally, the host kernel is no longer exposed to the hypervisor's security vulnerabilities.

    <source media="(prefers-color-scheme: dark)" srcset="./figures/arch-isol-dark.png 4x">
    <source media="(prefers-color-scheme: light)" srcset="./figures/arch-isol-light.png 4x">
    <img alt="Architecture of DuVisor." src="./figures/arch-isol-light.png 4x">
</picture>

Unlike traditional virtualization, all data interactions between the VM and the hypervisor are no longer mediated by the host kernel. DuVisor can directly handle VM traps in a more integrated way, reducing complexity while boosting performance.

DuVisor relies on a new hardware extension called DV-Ext to catch VM exits directly in user space. This hardware extension imports VM exits directly into the user state, providing virtualization-related registers that user-level software can use to access VM states and control VM behaviors.

    <img alt="Architecture of DuVisor." src="./figures/arch-plane-light.png 4x">
</picture>

Because DuVisor is developed in user space, it is more flexible than kernel modules. For instance, it uses the Rust language to build the main functionalities and therefore provides strong security. DuVisor can also quickly reuse existing off-the-shelf projects, such as Firecracker's I/O backend.

## Quick Start

### Prerequisite

Hardware requirements:

* CPU: Commodity CPU with >= 4 cores which is able to run QEMU. Architecture is not limitted.
* Memory: >8GB

First, clone this repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/IPADS-DuVisor/DuVisor
cd DuVisor
git submodule update --init --recursive
```

We provide a docker image to build the whole environment for x86-64 CPUs, as well as the [Dockerfile](./scripts/opensource/Dockerfile) of this image.

(Optional) To set up native environment for building, you can follow the Dockerfile.

Install Docker: https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/ubuntu/

Prepare source code for guest VM:
```bash
wget https://cdn.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/v5.x/linux-5.11.tar.xz
tar xf linux-5.11.tar.xz
mv linux-5.11 linux-guest
```

Prepare source code of busybox for rootfs:
```bash
mkdir -p prepare
cd prepare
git clone https://github.com/kvm-riscv/howto.git
wget https://busybox.net/downloads/busybox-1.33.1.tar.bz2
tar xf busybox-1.33.1.tar.bz2
mv busybox-1.33.1 rootfs
cd ..
```

### Build DuVisor for QEMU

You can build DuVisor and other elements for executing DuVisor (host/guest Linux kernel, rootfs, opensbi) via **one of** the following two scripts: 

[Build via docker](./scripts/quick_docker_build.sh):

```bash
./scripts/quick_docker_build.sh
```

[Native build](./scripts/quick_native_build.sh):

```bash
./scripts/quick_native_build.sh
```

### Run Example VM on QEMU

If you use docker build in last step:

```bash
./scripts/build/docker_exec_wrapper.sh ./scripts/run/example_boot.sh

# In QEMU
cd duvisor
./boot.sh
```

If you use native build in last step:

```bash
./scripts/run/example_boot.sh

# In QEMU
cd duvisor
./boot.sh
```

You would see `DUVISOR` then.

Reference bootlog:
```
bash> ./scripts/run/example_boot.sh

### Build DuVisor for FireSim

To run DuVisor on the FireSim platform, you only need to checkout to the `firesim` branch and apply a `firesim.patch` to the guest kernel code.
Other steps are the same as [Build DuVisor for QEMU](#build-duvisor-for-qemu).

To apply `firesim.patch` to the guest kernel code:

```bash
wget https://cdn.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/v5.x/linux-5.11.tar.xz
tar xf linux-5.11.tar.xz
mv linux-5.11 linux-guest
cd linux-guest
patch -p1 < ../firesim.patch
```

To run on FireSim, please use the Rocket-Chip with DV-ext enabled.
We have provided a compiled hardware on AWS, you can refer to our AE for more details:

```bash
# config_runtime.ini
defaulthwconfig=firesim-rocket-quadcore-nic-l2-llc4mb-ddr3-ulh-VNA-4TLB-4PTW-IBCN-vssip

# config_hwdb.ini

deploytripletoverride=None
customruntimeconfig=None
```

### Security Evaluation for DuVisor

DuVisor is able to prevent host kernel from crashing even if the user-level virtualization module is attacked. We have tested and emulated the following CVEs: they would make DuVisor crash, but the host kernel can continue to execute other programs (including DuVisor VM) normally.

Steps for preparation of the execution environment for security evaluation for DuVisor are the same as [Build DuVisor for QEMU](#build-duvisor-for-qemu).

All the following CVEs can be tested without rebooting or shutting down the host kernel. Therefore, you may boot the host kernel only once:

```bash
# Boot host kernel
./scripts/run/example_boot.sh

# Enter the directory storing the scripts
cd duvisor
```

#### [CVE-2017-12188 Memory Virtualization](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2017-12188)

Description:

> arch/x86/kvm/mmu.c in the Linux kernel through 4.13.5, when nested virtualisation is used, does not properly traverse guest pagetable entries to resolve a guest virtual address, which allows L1 guest OS users to execute arbitrary code on the host OS or cause a denial of service (incorrect index during page walking, and host OS crash), aka an "MMU potential **stack buffer overrun**."

DuVisor does not support nested virtualization, but we emulate a **stack buffer overrun** in [stage-2 page fault handling](https://github.com/IPADS-DuVisor/DuVisor/blob/security-ae/src/duvisor/src/vcpu/virtualcpu.rs#L612) which would randomly crash DuVisor.

Execute the following command to emulate this CVE:
```bash
./boot-cve.sh 1

# Generate a large amount of stage-2 page fault
mkdir tmp
mount -t tmpfs tmpfs /tmp
dd if=/dev/zero of=/tmp/tmp bs=1G count=2
```

It would crash with output like the following:
```txt
Emulating CVE-2017-12188 (stack buffer overrun) in memory virtualizaion!
```

The host kernel can still run normally. You can continue to boot DuVisor VMs test other CVEs.

#### [CVE-2018-16882 Interrupt Virtualization](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2018-16882)

Description:

> A **use-after-free** issue was found in the way the Linux kernel's KVM hypervisor processed posted interrupts when nested(=1) virtualization is enabled. In nested_get_vmcs12_pages(), in case of an error while processing posted interrupt address, it unmaps the 'pi_desc_page' without resetting 'pi_desc' descriptor address, which is later used in pi_test_and_clear_on(). A guest user/process could use this flaw to crash the host kernel resulting in DoS or potentially gain privileged access to a system. Kernel versions before 4.14.91 and before 4.19.13 are vulnerable.

We emulate a **use-after-free** in [interrupt virtualization](https://github.com/IPADS-DuVisor/DuVisor/blob/security-ae/src/duvisor/src/devices/vplic.rs#L71) which would randomly crash DuVisor.

Execute the following command to emulate this CVE:
```bash
./boot-cve.sh 2

# Execute ls to get a lot of interrupts from tty device
ls
```

It would crash with output like the following:

```txt
Emulating CVE-2018-16882 (use-after-free) in posted interrupt!
```

#### [CVE-2016-8630 ISA Emulation](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2016-8630)

Description:

> The x86_decode_insn function in arch/x86/kvm/emulate.c in the Linux kernel before 4.8.7, when KVM is enabled, allows local users to cause a denial of service (host OS crash) via a certain use of a ModR/M byte in an **undefined instruction**.

We emulate an **undefined instruction** in [ISA emulation](https://github.com/IPADS-DuVisor/DuVisor/blob/security-ae/src/duvisor/src/vcpu/virtualcpu.rs#L223) which would randomly crash DuVisor.

Execute the following command to emulate this CVE:
```bash
./boot-cve.sh 3

# Wait and it would crash randomly.
```

It would crash with output like the following:

```txt
Emulating CVE-2016-8630 (undefined instruction) in ISA emulation!
```

#### [CVE-2020-8834 VM Exit Handling](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-8834)

Description:

> KVM in the Linux kernel on Power8 processors has a conflicting use of HSTATE_HOST_R1 to store r1 state in kvmppc_hv_entry plus in kvmppc_{save,restore}_tm, leading to a **stack corruption**. Because of this, an attacker with the ability run code in kernel space of a guest VM can cause the host kernel to panic.

We emulate a **stack corruption** in [VM exit handling](https://github.com/IPADS-DuVisor/DuVisor/blob/security-ae/src/duvisor/src/vcpu/virtualcpu.rs#L757) which would randomly crash DuVisor.

Execute the following command to emulate this CVE:
```bash
./boot-cve.sh 4

# Wait and it would crash randomly.
```

It would crash with output like the following:

```txt
Emulating CVE-2020-8834 (stack corruption) in VM exit!
```

#### [CVE-2016-5412 Para-Virtualization](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2016-5412)

Description:

> arch/powerpc/kvm/book3s_hv_rmhandlers.S in the Linux kernel through 4.7 on PowerPC platforms, when CONFIG_KVM_BOOK3S_64_HV is enabled, allows guest OS users to cause a denial of service (host OS **infinite loop**) by making a H_CEDE hypercall during the existence of a suspended transaction.

We emulate a **infinite loop** by calling `panic` in [para-virtualization](https://github.com/IPADS-DuVisor/DuVisor/blob/security-ae/src/duvisor/src/plat/opensbi/emulation.rs#L158) which would randomly crash DuVisor.

Execute the following command to emulate this CVE:
```bash
./boot-cve.sh 5

# Wait and it would crash randomly.
```

It would crash with output like the following:

```txt
Emulating CVE-2016-5412 (infinite loop) in para-virtualization!
```

#### [CVE-2019-6974 Device Virtualization](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2019-6974)

Description:

> In the Linux kernel before 4.20.8, kvm_ioctl_create_device in virt/kvm/kvm_main.c mishandles reference counting because of a race condition, leading to a **use-after-free**.

We emulate a **use-after-free** in [device virtualization](https://github.com/IPADS-DuVisor/DuVisor/blob/security-ae/src/devices/src/serial.rs#L199) which would randomly crash DuVisor.

Execute the following command to emulate this CVE:
```bash
./boot-cve.sh 6

# DuVisor would crash if the tty device prints "DV-cve".
echo DV-cve
```

It would crash with output like the following:

```txt
Emulating CVE-2019-6974 (use-after-free) in device virtualization!
```
