DuVisor is a user-level hypervisor with high performance based on delegated virtualization. It deprivileges all the vulnerable subsystems of traditional hypervisors into user space, reducing the host kernelâ€™s attack surface and preventing any of hypervisor's vulnerabilities from jeopardizing it. The Rust language and one-to-one model further ensures the isolation and reliability.

## Why DuVisor

Compared with traditional virtualization, DuVisor offers several advantages:

1. **High Security:** By using a deprivileged hypervisor, DuVisor eliminates the kernel's attack surface introduced by virtualization. Moreover, the one-to-one service model improves the isolation between virtual machines (VMs) and the fault tolerance of the system.

2. **Near-native Performance:** DuVisor eliminates redundant mode switching, thereby fully unleashing the potential performance of virtualization. The integrated design also improves cooperation between modules, making the code more efficient.

3. **Agile Development:** Because of the thriving software environment in user space, DuVisor is no longer constrained by kernel development environments and can freely choose programming languages and existing libraries. Currently, the project uses Rust to ensure security and takes advantage of its powerful testing framework to improve project quality.

4. **Flexible Operations and Maintenance:** DuVisor can be upgraded without rebooting the host system. New features and functionalities can be deployed more quickly. Cloud services will have better fault tolerance, benefiting from DuVisor's strong isolation.

## Duvisor's Architecture

DuVisor adopts a one-to-one model to serve virtual machines (VMs) directly in user space, providing greater isolation to the entire system.

    <source media="(prefers-color-scheme: dark)" srcset="./figures/arch-dark.png 3x">
    <source media="(prefers-color-scheme: light)" srcset="./figures/arch-light.png 3x">
    <img alt="Architecture of DuVisor." src="./figures/arch-light.png 3x">
</picture>

With a separate hypervisor process that only serves itself, each VM gains stronger isolation from other VMs and DuVisor processes. Additionally, the host kernel is no longer exposed to the hypervisor's security vulnerabilities.

    <img alt="Architecture of DuVisor." src="./figures/arch-isol-light.png 4x">
</picture>

Unlike traditional virtualization, all data interactions between the VM and the hypervisor are no longer mediated by the host kernel. DuVisor can directly handle VM traps in a more integrated way, reducing complexity while boosting performance.

DuVisor relies on a new hardware extension called DV-Ext to catch VM exits directly in user space. This hardware extension imports VM exits directly into the user state, providing virtualization-related registers that user-level software can use to access VM states and control VM behaviors.

    <img alt="Architecture of DuVisor." src="./figures/arch-plane-light.png 4x">
</picture>

Because DuVisor is developed in user space, it is more flexible than kernel modules. For instance, it uses the Rust language to build the main functionalities and therefore provides strong security. DuVisor can also quickly reuse existing off-the-shelf projects, such as Firecracker's I/O backend.

## Quick Start

### Prerequisite

Hardware requirements:

* CPU: Commodity CPU with >= 4 cores which is able to run QEMU. Architecture is not limited.
* Memory: >8GB

First, clone this repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/IPADS-DuVisor/DuVisor
cd DuVisor
git submodule update --init --recursive
```

We provide a docker image to build the whole environment for x86-64 CPUs, as well as the [Dockerfile](./scripts/opensource/Dockerfile) of this image.

(Optional) To set up a native environment for building, you can follow the Dockerfile.

Install Docker: https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/ubuntu/

Prepare source code for guest VM:
```bash
wget https://cdn.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/v5.x/linux-5.11.tar.xz
tar xf linux-5.11.tar.xz
mv linux-5.11 linux-guest
```

Prepare source code of busybox for rootfs:
```bash
mkdir -p prepare
cd prepare
git clone https://github.com/kvm-riscv/howto.git
wget https://busybox.net/downloads/busybox-1.33.1.tar.bz2
tar xf busybox-1.33.1.tar.bz2
mv busybox-1.33.1 rootfs
cd ..
```

### Build DuVisor for QEMU

You can build DuVisor and other elements for executing DuVisor (host/guest Linux kernel, rootfs,OpenSBI) via **one of** the following two scripts: 

[Build via docker](./scripts/quick_docker_build.sh):

```bash
./scripts/quick_docker_build.sh
```

[Native build](./scripts/quick_native_build.sh):

```bash
./scripts/quick_native_build.sh
```

### Run Example VM on QEMU

If you use the docker build in the last step:

```bash
./scripts/build/docker_exec_wrapper.sh ./scripts/run/example_boot.sh

# In QEMU
cd duvisor
./boot.sh
```

If you use the native build in the last step:

```bash
./scripts/run/example_boot.sh

# In QEMU
cd duvisor
./boot.sh
```

You would see `DuVisor` then.

Reference boot log:
```
bash> ./scripts/run/example_boot.sh

### Build DuVisor for FireSim

To run DuVisor on the FireSim platform, you only need to checkout to the `firesim` branch and apply a `firesim.patch` to the guest kernel code.
Other steps are the same as [Build DuVisor for QEMU](#build-duvisor-for-qemu).

To apply `firesim.patch` to the guest kernel code:

```bash
wget https://cdn.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/v5.x/linux-5.11.tar.xz
tar xf linux-5.11.tar.xz
mv linux-5.11 linux-guest
cd linux-guest
patch -p1 < ../firesim.patch
```

To run on FireSim, please use the Rocket-Chip with DV-ext enabled.
We have provided a compiled hardware on AWS, you can refer to our AE for more details:

```bash
# config_runtime.ini
defaulthwconfig=firesim-rocket-quadcore-nic-l2-llc4mb-ddr3-ulh-VNA-4TLB-4PTW-IBCN-vssip

# config_hwdb.ini
